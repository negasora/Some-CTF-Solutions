artifact title: A-199530

description:
  when a photo is taken with artifact in frame,
  photo is distorted and contains what looks like a
  barcode, left to right, top to bottom. however,
  it is not a standard barcode and appears to encode
  a long stream of bits, either being negative or
  positive. additionally, the message appears to be
  some type of audio.

additional notes from lab:
  ABCD = [1, 0, 1, -1
          1, 1, 1, -2
          0, 1, 0,  0]
  order = 2
